Automatically generates a regular expression using Genetic Programming

The goal of this project is to generate a regular expression search pattern, given a target chuck of free text. The search pattern will be constructed by using a custom Genetic Algorithm (GA). The GA will use various Regex string subcomponents as genes concatinated sets of these genes will become chromosomes. The fitness function will evaluate an individual's chromosome against the user define example string(s). The workflow is as follows, a user will provide the algorithm an initial string, such as an ip address [71.127.215.54]. From generation to generation, individuals will pass on successful genes (regex components) to their offspring and as this race evolves a better and better regular expression search string will be defined. Once this pattern has converged via the fitness function, the expression can be optimized using a number of open source tools. The search space for a regex search pattern is enourmous, but by structuring a chromosome and properly leveraging mutations, elitism, CRISPR, and other items, I believe that the code will be fast enough for use by a Data Scientist.
